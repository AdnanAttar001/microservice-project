2-Tier Architecture Microservice Deployment using Docker, Nginx & Node.js
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a 2-Tier Microservice Architecture using Docker, Nginx Reverse Proxy, and Node.js.

The application consists of multiple independent Node.js microservices deployed inside Docker containers. Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and routes incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate backend service using proxy_pass.

Docker Compose is used to build, manage, and deploy all containers efficiently.

⚙️ Architecture Components
1. Nginx Reverse Proxy

Nginx receives client requests on port 80 and forwards them to the appropriate Node.js microservice using proxy_pass.

Endpoint        Backend Service
/users  User Service
/products       Product Service
2. User Service

A Node.js microservice responsible for handling user-related requests.

Port: 3001

Endpoint:

http
GET /users


Sample Response:

json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "David"
  }
]

3. Product Service

A Node.js microservice responsible for handling product-related requests.

Port: 3002

Endpoint:

http
GET /products


Sample Response:

json
[
  {
    "id": 101,
    "name": "Laptop"
  },
  {
    "id": 102,
    "name": "Mobile"
  }
]

🛠️ Prerequisites

Before deploying the project, install:

Docker
Docker Compose (Docker Compose V2 plugin)
Git
Linux / Ubuntu / Windows with Docker Desktop

Verify installations:

bash
docker --version
docker compose version
git --version

🚀 Deployment Instructions
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/microservice-project.git

cd microservice-project


Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username.

Step 2: Build Docker Images
bash
docker compose build

Step 3: Start Containers
bash
docker compose up -d

Step 4: Verify Running Containers
bash
docker ps


Expected containers:

Container       Service Port
nginx-proxy     Nginx   80
user-service    Node.js 3001 (internal)
product-service Node.js 3002 (internal)
Step 5: Check Container Logs
bash
docker compose logs -f

🧪 Application Testing

After successful deployment, test the following endpoints.

1. Nginx Reverse Proxy

bash
curl http://localhost/


Expected output:

text
Nginx Reverse Proxy is Running!


2. User Service

bash
curl http://localhost/users


Expected output:

json
[
  {"id":1,"name":"John"},
  {"id":2,"name":"David"}
]


3. Product Service

bash
curl http://localhost/products


Expected output:

json
[
  {"id":101,"name":"Laptop"},
  {"id":102,"name":"Mobile"}
]

🐳 Docker Commands
Command Description
docker ps       View running containers
docker images   List Docker images
docker compose up -d    Start containers
docker compose down     Stop and remove containers
docker compose restart  Restart containers
docker compose logs -f  View application logs
docker compose build    Build Docker images
docker compose down --rmi local Remove project containers and local images
docker exec -it nginx-proxy sh  Access Nginx container
🔄 Request Flow
Client sends an HTTP request to Nginx on port 80.
Nginx receives the incoming request.
Nginx checks the URL path.
Based on the URL, Nginx forwards the request to the corresponding Node.js microservice.
The microservice processes the request.
The backend sends a response to Nginx.
Nginx returns the response to the client.
🔐 Security & Best Practices

For production deployment, consider implementing:

HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates.
Nginx security headers.
Health checks for containers.
Docker resource limits.
Environment variables for sensitive configuration.
Centralized logging and monitoring.
Non-root Docker containers.
Regular Docker image updates.
